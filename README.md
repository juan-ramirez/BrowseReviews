# BrowseReviews

This is a code challenge for GetYourGuide, by no means I own any copy righted information related to the endpoints exposed, and won't be responsible whatsoever for any maintenance of this project

Usage:

1. Open the App 
2. See Review list
3. Press any of the floating buttons to see it by rating or date of review (asc/desc property switches but button color doesn't ... I know)

*things I totally didn't do because I had no time.

- Tests: Unit Tests, espresso tests ... etc
- Error Handling: well, like at all, I didn't have time to check on possible error codes and deliver them to the user because it takes forever, just added a minimal error Snackbar to inform the user its not working for any reason**
- Pretty UI: yeah ...  
- Documentation: Project is short and sweet like brigadeiros and doesn't need much explanation, if so please mail me or something
- 


**Disclaimers

- Not everything was fully tested
- Display how many reviews and the overall rating not implemented
- Display only Count 0 and Page 0 for testing purposes (can be adjusted under any arbitrary decisions but I didn't)
